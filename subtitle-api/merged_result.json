  "content": "Task 1: Paragraph\nWhen I was 24 years old, I heard something that changed the trajectory of my career and life. I had just started working for an airline that declared bankruptcy, a historic company with a rich history of providing the gift of flight to millions. However, saving the company meant making many hard choices, including layoffs, which was devastating as it meant letting go of friends and colleagues who had spent decades serving the company. To help with this difficult task, a company was brought in to coach us. The facilitator posed a thought-provoking question, \"What if being laid off could actually be a good thing?\" This led me to consider the potential positive outcomes of such a situation, despite my initial skepticism. The facilitator shared research demonstrating how layoffs could often lead to unexpected blessings in disguise, pushing individuals out of their comfort zones and towards new opportunities.\n\nThis belief in the positive aspects of change stayed with me throughout my career as I transitioned into a leadership role, guiding various companies through transformation and change. I have witnessed firsthand the power of change in driving growth and improvement, even in the face of significant challenges like a global pandemic. The ever-evolving nature of the world necessitates adaptability and a willingness to embrace change, a concept that not everyone finds easy. Despite the natural inclination to resist change due to biological wiring, helping individuals understand the why behind change and managing their cognitive load can facilitate smoother transitions and foster a more positive perspective towards change.\n\nTask 2: Vocabulary Teaching\n1.
