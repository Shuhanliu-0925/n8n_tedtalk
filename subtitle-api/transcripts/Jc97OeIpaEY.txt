When I was 24 years old,
I heard something that changed
the trajectory of my career and my life.
I had just started working for an airline
that declared bankruptcy.
This was a historic company
with a rich history
of giving the gift of flight to millions.
But we knew that saving the company
would mean making many hard choices,
including layoffs.
It was devastating for people
to think about letting go
of friends and colleagues,
many that had spent decades
serving this company.
To help us with this very difficult task,
a company was brought in to coach us.
I will never forget
what the facilitator said.
He asked, "What if
for everyone that is laid off,
it is actually a good thing?"
I was shocked.
How could being laid off
be a good thing for anyone?
I know if I lost my paycheck,
I would be concerned about
how I was going to pay my rent,
the many other bills I had,
worried about health insurance
and paying for basics like groceries.
And what would it mean
for my career and my future?
So how could being laid off
be a good thing for anybody?
But I kept my mind open
just long enough to hear the research.
He shared that he had tracked employees
that had been laid off over time,
and saw that in most cases,
it was actually a blessing in disguise.
People were forced out of a career rut.
With support, with severance packages,
recommendations
and support from their networks,
these laid off employees
went on to challenge themselves
to do something different.
They started new jobs
that gave them opportunities
that accelerated their career path.
They actually went on
to start new businesses,
learn new skills and go back to college.
So in that moment,
it became a guiding belief for me,
for my career and my life
that change is always a good thing.
Even if forced upon you,
if you're curious and patient enough,
you will find the good in it.
So now, whenever
a major change happens to me,
even if negative or forced upon me,
I take the time and ask myself,
"What if this is happening for me?"
Today I'm a transformation
leader and executive.
I have helped many companies,
small and large, around the globe
through transformation and change.
Many of these companies
you would recognize,
delivering billions of value
while improving the employee experience.
I've worked with a global manufacturer
to rescale their entire organization.
I've worked with a mining company
that was three months
from closing their doors
to being profitable again.
And through the COVID-19 pandemic,
I worked with one of the most
impacted industries: grocery stores.
So I've seen a lot of change.
And what I do know
is that in today's world,
the only constant is change.
Change is not going away.
And in fact, it is getting
harder and more frequent.
Lucky for me, I love to change.
I actually seek it out.
But for many, they hate change,
and in fact, most people hate change.
It is true that we are biologically
wired to hate change.
Our brains are designed
to avoid uncertainty and avoid threat.
The instant you feel threatened,
your amygdala begins
to release stress hormones
of cortisol and adrenaline.
This happens instantaneously
and unconsciously.
So imagine youâ€™re walking in the woods,
and you see a bear.
What does your brain tell you to do?
"Scary animal.
Run."
But the reality is that is just
the stress hormones talking.
What you need to do is tap
into the rational side of your brain
and realize the next best step
is to actually stay still.
This chemical cocktail
is happening to you,
regardless if you're staring
at a bear in the woods
or your CEO has just announced a merger.
Change feels bad.
This is one of the reasons why
75 percent of corporate
transformations fail.
Think about the last time
you experienced a change.
Did people respond with excitement
and open-mindedness,
or did they immediately start listing out
all the things that would go wrong?
Saying things like,
"Change never works. This will fail."
Or one of my favorites,
"If we wait this out long enough,
it will go away."
It doesn't matter how good
your change management strategy is
if the humans you are working with
are consciously or unconsciously
working against you.
It's what they're wired to do.
So change management at its core
is actually about helping people overcome
that natural wiring to hate change
and tap into their intellectual potential
to advance the change.
So the question is,
in a world of constant change,
how can we get more people
to hate change less,
maybe even get excited about it?
The answer is to humanize it.
After all, it is humans
that will activate the change.
We have to think about the human element
across any dimension
of a change or a transformation.
And there are many ways to do that.
But here are two of my favorite.
Anytime you're beginning a change journey,
sit down and write down
your personal change story,
and have your teams do it, too.
This is the why you
are motivated to change
and why you're committed
to seeing it through.
Knowing your why and revisiting it
often through the change
will help you overcome
that natural wiring to hate change.
The problem is, when most leaders
think about change and talk about change,
they talk about the success metrics
of improving shareholder value,
or the stock price, or how people make
a lot of money and big bonuses from it.
But that is not
what motivates most people.
I founded the Behavioral
Science Lab at BCG
to better understand
what drives human behavior.
And one thing we know
is there are five primary motivators
to why people are motivated to change:
personal achievement, customers, teams,
community and financial outcomes.
You will resonate with all five
to some varying degree,
but one will matter more to you.
See if you can spot yourself
in these five.
Personal achievement.
If you're motivated
by personal achievement,
you love career milestones.
Bigger promotions. Bigger titles.
Getting on that exclusive project.
If you are motivated by customers,
you want to see your products
and services out in the real world
and hear from people
on how to make them better
so that you can improve things for them.
If you're motivated by teams,
you care about the people
you work with a lot,
you think about the environment
in which teaming occurs.
I could give you a big bonus check,
and in six months,
if you hate the team you're working with,
you'll probably leave.
Alternatively, if you love
the team you're working with,
I might find you at 2am
working in the trenches with them
if that's what they needed.
If you're motivated by community,
you need to know that the place
that you are spending time with
is really working
to make the world a better place.
Think about the corporate programs
around cancer awareness
or jobs programs or food drives.
People that care about
really advancing the community
as a primary motivator
need to know the company
is focused on that.
Financial outcomes is pretty simple.
How many dollar signs
are on the other side of this change?
Did one of those resonate with you more?
If I asked 100 people the same question,
"What motivates you?",
and gave them these five categories,
they would be pretty evenly split
in their response,
which means if leaders
are talking about financial outcomes
and personal achievement, like bonuses,
they are leaving 60 people
unmotivated and uninspired to change.
That's why when I lead change,
I ask everyone to write
their personal change story,
but then talk about the success metrics
on all five of those dimensions.
For example, when working
with the mining company,
one leader shared how he had grown up
in extreme poverty.
He was horrified to see
how many wasted resources
and lost value there was at the company.
He shared how if
the transformation was successful,
the company would ultimately be able
to get more investment from shareholders.
That's financial.
And with that additional investment,
they could purchase new equipment,
which would make them more productive,
allowing them to keep prices low.
That's customers.
And with improved profits
they would be able to invest in wages --
personal achievement --
and most importantly to him,
be able to invest more
in the company's reduced poverty
campaign -- community.
Plus in a better operating company,
teams would have
more time to spend together
on learning and development.
When he finished his story, he was crying,
as were many others in the room.
It was in that moment
that the transformation went
from being about delivering dollars
to being a mission,
to being the best
operating company possible
to improve outcomes for everyone.
This was a transformation
that everyone could see themselves in.
And what's interesting is once
you know what motivates somebody,
you can use that throughout the process
to remind them why
they're motivated to change
and fight that biological wiring.
For example, email segmentation
and AI automation
has made it incredibly easy
to send varying communications
to different people.
So someone who's motivated by teams
and someone that's motivated by financials
can get different communications
that hit on their primary motivators.
If it's true that people
are motivated by different things,
it is also true that they have
different capacity.
This leads me to my second tip.
Most organizations manage change
through activity heat maps
and assume that people
have the same capacity.
The problem with this is
you might have one team member
that has six tasks assigned to them,
and they could easily take on eight,
while another is experiencing
a divorce at home
and the most they can handle is three.
To action my second tip,
measure cognitive load
and adjust accordingly.
Cognitive load consists of two variables:
confidence and capacity.
Capacity is simple.
Do you have the time, energy and resources
you need to complete a task?
Confidence is, do you believe
in your ability to complete that task?
So how do we measure this?
We ask people with a simple survey
how they are feeling:
excited, tired, proud, anxious and so on.
Then we ask them a simple question
around cognitive load.
We ask questions like cognitive load
questions about capacity.
A simple question
about capacity looks like:
"How effectively can you juggle
your roles both at home and at work?"
Then we ask a question about confidence.
In facing a difficult task,
how certain are you
that you can finish that task?
When teams finish
this five-minute simple survey,
we have a better understanding
of their cognitive load
and can adjust things.
For someone that is thriving,
we can give them a new opportunity
and really challenge
and help them develop.
For someone that is struggling,
we can reduce the workload
or offer up a unique intervention.
This is where my two tips come together.
For someone that is struggling,
we can take a moment and remind them
of the why they are excited to change.
And if they're struggling with confidence,
we can boost it with a trusted leader
sending a thoughtful note.
It is these interventions that allow us
to help people move through the change
and fight that biological wiring
to resist change.
There is so much good
that can come from change
when done right.
And doing change right
starts with the simple recognition
that humans will lead the change.
Us messy, complicated humans
with our differing motivations,
insecurities and full lives.
But by humanizing change,
we can help people
through understanding their why,
and we can help them manage
their cognitive load.
This will allow them
to keep fighting against that resistance
and thinking change is bad.
And maybe see the positive that can come
both professionally
and personally from change.
Because there is good in every change.
You just have to find it.
Thank you.
